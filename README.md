# Digital Forensics Investigative Plan

## Introduction

With the increasing reliance on electronic data storage, the need for digital forensics has become critical in uncovering evidence of illegal or unauthorized activities. This document outlines an investigative action plan to address a case involving suspected unauthorized access to proprietary information by a mechanical engineer at an oil company. The plan adheres to forensic best practices and standards to ensure a thorough and legally compliant investigation.

## Scenario

John Smith, a mechanical engineer at the company, is suspected of accessing proprietary information without authorization. The company's legal office has requested digital evidence to verify the potential violation of company policy, which prohibits sharing proprietary information without approval. All employees are bound by nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and acceptable use policies (AUPs). The request for digital evidence has been approved by senior management and the legal office.

## Investigative Plan of Action

### 1. Strategy for Evidence Collection and Minimization of Impact

**Strategy Overview:**
To maximize evidence collection and minimize organizational impact, our team will implement a structured approach that includes:

- **Preparation and Coordination:** Establish clear communication channels with senior management and IT to schedule the investigation with minimal disruption.
- **Non-Intrusive Methods:** Utilize read-only forensic tools and ensure minimal interaction with live systems to avoid altering evidence or disrupting operations.
- **Timing:** Conduct evidence collection during off-hours or scheduled maintenance windows to reduce operational impact.

### 2. Tools and Techniques for Evidence Gathering, Preparation, and Analysis

**Tools:**
- **Forensic Imaging Tools:** FTK Imager, EnCase Imager
- **Analysis Software:** FTK Imager, EnCase Forensic, X1 Social Discovery
- **Data Recovery Tools:** Data Doctor, Ophcrack

**Techniques:**
- **Disk Imaging:** Create bit-for-bit copies of storage media to ensure original data remains unaltered.
- **Data Integrity Verification:** Use hash algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) to verify the integrity of collected evidence.
- **Log Analysis:** Review system logs and access records to trace unauthorized activity.

### 3. Collection and Preservation of Evidence

**Procedure:**
- **Chain of Custody:** Document all handling of evidence to maintain a verifiable chain of custody.
- **Standardized Procedures:** Follow established protocols for evidence collection, including using forensic write blockers to prevent modification of original data.
- **Environmental Controls:** Ensure evidence is stored in a secure, controlled environment to prevent tampering or degradation.

### 4. Examination of Seized Evidence

**Examination Process:**
- **Data Filtering:** Use forensic tools to filter and categorize data relevant to the suspected policy violation.
- **Keyword Searching:** Employ keyword searches to identify files or communications related to proprietary information.
- **File Analysis:** Examine file metadata, access logs, and content to link evidence to the suspected policy breach.

### 5. Drawing Conclusions from Digital Evidence

**Approach:**
- **Correlation:** Correlate evidence with company policies and access controls to determine if unauthorized access occurred.
- **Evidence Corroboration:** Cross-reference digital evidence with employee records and access rights to support or refute the violation claim.
- **Reporting:** Prepare a detailed report of findings, including evidence and rationale, to substantiate the conclusion of a policy breach.

### 6. Presentation of Case Details and Conclusions

**Presentation Approach:**
- **Executive Summary:** Provide a concise summary of findings and conclusions for senior management.
- **Detailed Report:** Include a comprehensive report with evidence, analysis methods, and conclusions.
- **Recommendations:** Offer recommendations for policy enforcement or corrective actions based on findings.
